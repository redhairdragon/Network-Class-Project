## Project 1

The goal of this project is to develop a Web server in C/C++ using BSD sockets. In
addition, by doing this project, we took the chance to learn a little bit more about how the Web
browser and server work behind the scene.

## Project 2

The purpose of this project is to use UDP Socket and C/C++ programming language to
implement a reliable data transfer protocol (TCP). Since UDP itself is a not reliable data
protocol, the goal of this project is to fully understand and learn how to implement a simple
congestion window-based TCP protocol.
