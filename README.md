## Project 1

The purpose of this project is to use UDP Socket and C/C++ programming language to
implement a reliable data transfer protocol (TCP). Since UDP itself is a not reliable data
protocol, the goal of this project is to fully understand and learn how to implement a simple
congestion window-based TCP protocol.
